# MusicNotationRecongnitionSystem
Ongoing project aiming to build a big project within 4 months that emphasizes the GUI - the Graphical User Interface. 
We will build a gesture based music notation system. The music notation is clearly graphical and is 
quite structured so we will have to build classes that support that structure in order to draw it on the screen. 
The gestures, on the other hand, represent a method of user input and is intended to implement both some pattern 
recognition AI techniques and also to force to think about how we want the user to interface with our system.
